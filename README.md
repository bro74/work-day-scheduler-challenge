# work-day-scheduler-challenge

## Description 

This challenge was an **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** that gave starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The user is an employee with a busy schedule who wants to add important events to a daily planner so they can  manage their time effectively. I simply followed the acceptance criteria. I found this challenge fairly starightforward. I need to work on my commits. I get wrapped in the coding I forget to pause and commit! I except the next challenge will be more difficult.
